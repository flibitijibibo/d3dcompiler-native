About d3dcompiler-native
------------------------
d3dcompiler-native was written to be used for FNA3D's dxvk-native support. The
Wine team's d3dcompiler is actually a frontend for vkd3d-shader, so we simply
reuse their frontend code and compile as a native binary, linking to vkd3d.

Dependencies
------------
d3dcompiler-native requires dxvk-native's headers to build.
malloc/free are used in our custom ID3DBlob implementation.
memcpy/memcmp are used in Wine's D3DCompile implementation.

Building d3dcompiler-native
---------------------------
Clone d3dcompiler-native and dxvk-native next to each other, then enter this
directory and simply type `make`!

Found an issue?
---------------
Issues and patches can be reported via GitHub:

https://github.com/flibitijibibo/d3dcompiler-native/issues

However, it is highly likely that issues will actually be in vkd3d-shader
instead, so you may also want to file reports at WineHQ:
